<p>Makes Wood Bridges craftable directly from the player inventory. That's it.</p>
<p>Probably only needed client side in multiplayer (haven't got the chance to test it yet)</p>
<h3>Known Bugs</h3>
<p>For bug reports, please ping <code>robb4</code> in the <code>#modding-chat</code> on the Core Keeper discord.</p>
<ul>
<li>The crafting recipe sometimes appears multiple times. I don't know why this is, but it doesn't seem to break anything. Might be a bug with CoreLib.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Special Thanks</h3>
